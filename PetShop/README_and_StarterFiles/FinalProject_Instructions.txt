WEB 250 Final Project – 200 points

Create a database named petshop and create appropriate tables and data to handle the following:

    Modify the petmart.php page to be data driven

    Modify the petguide.php to be data driven

    Implement a manage.php to manage either the PetMart page or the PetGuide page (you

    can choose just one)

    Implement a registration/users/login process for the manage.php ; in other words a

    user cannot get to the manage page until they register and log in.

    Save the contact information from the form on the contacts.php

    Remember to create a connect_db.php file that lives in your includes folder – only have

    ONE connection to the database

    Zip your website and export your database and turn in two files to Moodle
